= Introduction

There's this really cool technology for automation of workflows, potential seems
to be endless (well, besides a paywall for certain features). I want to check out
its potential in order to add to my arsenal of knowledge.

This is the specific commands that I run on my Thinkpad to get a self-hosted
instance in seconds:

````
systemctl start docker

sudo docker volume create n8n_data

sudo docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="JP" \
 -e TZ="JP" \
 -e N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true \
 -e N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true \
 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

== A bit of theory

=== Main Idea

n8n is a workflow automation tool (similar to Zapier or Make, but source-available)
that lets you connect apps, services, and custom logic without heavy coding. Itâ€™s
designed for developers and non-technical users who want to automate repetitive
tasks and integrate different systems.

=== Problems to solve

- Too many disconnected tools â†’ Brings APIs, databases, cloud services, and
local apps into one automation flow.
- Repetitive manual work â†’ Automates recurring tasks (data entry, notifications,
syncs).
- Rigid SaaS limitations â†’ Being source-available and self-hostable, you can customize
it beyond the limits of hosted platforms like Zapier.
- High automation costs â†’ Self-hosting avoids per-workflow/per-task pricing models.

=== Biggest capabilities

- Visual workflow builder â†’ Drag-and-drop UI for creating complex flows.
- Over 500 integrations â†’ Connects to APIs, SaaS tools, databases, webhooks,
and custom scripts.
- Conditional logic & branching â†’ Add IF/ELSE paths, loops, and error handling.
- Custom code nodes â†’ Insert JavaScript/TypeScript when needed.
- Self-hosting â†’ Run on your own server for full control, or use n8n Cloud.
- Event-driven automation â†’ Triggers from schedules, webhooks, app events, or
database changes.

=== Common use cases

- CRM & marketing automation â†’ Sync leads between apps, send automated follow-ups.
- Data pipelines â†’ Extract, transform, and load (ETL) across databases, spreadsheets,
APIs.
- Notification workflows â†’ Send alerts to Slack, Teams, or email when conditions are met.
- DevOps & IT automation â†’ Monitor systems, auto-open tickets, restart services.
- E-commerce â†’ Automate order management, customer notifications, and inventory sync.
- Custom internal tools â†’ Tie together APIs and data sources for bespoke workflows.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: n8n is like Zapier on steroidsâ€”flexible, open-source, and
developer-friendlyâ€”ideal for anyone needing deep integrations and automations
without SaaS lock-in.

== Initial "Hello World"

Ripping this from the intro video, you can configure a **NODE**, to ingest RSS
feeds and then output them in the workflow.

ðŸ”— Ready-to-use Public RSS Feeds

You can plug these directly into n8n:

Hacker News (Top Stories)
https://hnrss.org/frontpage

BBC News (World)
http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml

NY Times (Technology)
https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Technology.xml

Reddit (any subreddit) â†’ just add .rss
Example: https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/.rss

Medium (any publication or user) â†’ add /feed
Example: https://medium.com/feed/tag/automation

[IMPORTANT]
====
The way I see it. RSS really fits into _data streaming_. With a trigger at a
point that generates data, or gets an event in place in order to execute a whole
set of steps (workflow). So it is an automation framework (with tons and tons
of integrations).
====

The fact that you can self-host one instance is pretty cool. But what I'm really
trying to find now is _can this all be represented in text_?

=== N8N and reproducible configs (text based)

**N8N stores workflows as JSON**

This is a snippet:

[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "My RSS Workflow",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {
        "url": "https://hnrss.org/frontpage"
      },
      "name": "RSS Feed",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.rssFeedRead",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "position": [200, 300]
    }
  ],
  "connections": {}
}
----

You can literally export this notation with the UI (on the web). And also
import them. (Recommended for small setups)

[IMPORTANT]
====
But because we know the shell (CLI) is the actual goat of next level _pragmatic
programmers_, we should leverage tools such as the `n8n` CLI tool. That gladly
is there on our instance ready to serve us.
====

````
n8n export:workflow --all --output=/path/to/workflows
n8n import:workflow --input=/path/to/workflows/
````

And credentials that are also needed depending on the node, can be imported
and exported with stuff like `n8n export:credentials` and `n8n import:credentials`.

This allows for us to then put all our configs/workflows under VCS, which is another
extremely good practice to have. ** Version Control _everything_.**

[NOTE]
====
We shouldn't version control credentials, that's sensitive information, even though
it will be encrypted and all. This is bad, we should always keep that offsite,
behind secrets, and changed through other more secure means.
====

_Extra interesting feature:_

- We can store multiple JSONs, one per workflow.
- We can also bundle them into a single directory structure: `/workflows`, `/credentials`,
`/config`
