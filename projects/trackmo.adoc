= Introduction

These are all notes that I will be taking when developing a personal tracking
application: https://github.com/diegowrhasta/trackMo[TrackMo].

== Base

A modern, good practice, automated project should always have.

- A clean `.gitignore` catered to your specific tech stack
- CI-CD pipelines (basic build, test, perhaps deploy)
- Static Code Analyzing
- Code Styles

=== .NET Project Specifics

- Leveraging modern .NET we can make usage of things such as:
	- Centralized Build Props
	- Centralized NuGet Packages
	- GlobalUsings
	- Top Level Statements
	- Code style file

== Setup

This project follows specific patterns:

- One Frontend Application
- One Backend Application
- Full Orchestration with Docker and Docker Compose

[NOTE]
====
Yes, it's true that we _could_ just have everything in ONE app, since we will
user Blazor Server Interactivity, and we could in theory connect directly to a
database there. But, separation of concerns, please. I **know** from experience
how easy that gets out of hand and compilations time take _forever_.
====

=== No Docker Compose command

- `docker info`
- `docker --version`
- `docker compose --version`
- `docker-compose --version`

If any of these fail, then that means the compose plugin _might not be installed_, 
You can just run something like: `yay -S docker-compose`.

=== Running the whole orchestrated environment

`docker compose up --build` is a good practice so that you know you are running the
latest builds with the latest pieces of code.

=== Blazorise installation

_WHY ARE YOU INSTALLING THIS?_ To **practice**. For what? 秘密〜

Following the guide at:

https://blazorise.com/docs/start[Blazor Docs]

We can install Blazorise pretty easily. _I Think_

[IMPORTANT]
====
Dude, be sure you have a `.gitignore` in your repo. Otherwise you will end up comitting
things YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.
====

To remove previously tracked files so that you stop pushing a repo that's heavier
than anti-matter: `git rm --cached -r path/to/directory`

Okay, I think I found my guy. The Blazor dude, the man, the rockstar:

=== Theming Blazorise

Okay, so I want to customize the component library to fit a specific palette.
One that's homely.

You can always look at designs others have made for inspiration. Here's what I got:

From here, I did a bit of _magic_ and landed on an interesting color palette:

https://www.petersondesignhouse.com/2022/01/color-palette-no-11.html[Color Palette]

- `#91AEB0`
- `#364A62`
- `#E3B386`
- `#DC8E75`
- `#B5594B`
- `#776C6B`

Juxtaposing this to hierarchies we can extract something like this:

- Primary = #364A62 (deep slate — used for main actions / header)
- Secondary = #DC8E75 (warm peach — accents)
- Success = #91AEB0 (muted teal — success states)
- Warning = #E3B386 (soft gold — warnings/notice)
- Danger = #B5594B (brick — errors)
- Info = #776C6B (muted mauve — info / subtle text)
- Background primary = #FFFFFF (keeps content readable)
- Background secondary = #F6F5F4 (subtle warm background)

==== Injecting color

Luckily Blazorise has a way to style things dynamically, without hard-coding, and
of course following good design patterns.

[source, razor]
.Routes.razor
----
<ThemeProvider Theme="AppTheme"> <.>
    <Router AppAssembly="typeof(Program).Assembly"> <.>
        <Found Context="routeData">
            <RouteView RouteData="routeData" DefaultLayout="typeof(Layout.MainLayout)"/>
            <FocusOnNavigate RouteData="routeData" Selector="h1"/>
        </Found>
    </Router>
</ThemeProvider>

@code {

    private Theme AppTheme = new()
    {
        ColorOptions = new ThemeColorOptions
        {
            Primary = "#364A62", // deep slate
            Secondary = "#DC8E75", // warm peach
            Success = "#91AEB0", // muted teal
            Warning = "#E3B386", // soft gold
            Danger = "#B5594B", // brick
            Info = "#776C6B", // muted mauve
            Light = "#F8F9FA",
            Dark = "#222222"
        },
        BackgroundOptions = new ThemeBackgroundOptions
        {
            Primary = "#FFFFFF", // main content background
            Secondary = "#F6F5F4" // subtle warm secondary background
        },
        IsRounded = true,
        IsGradient = false
    };

}
----
<.> By leveraging `<ThemeProvider>` we can easily inject a `Theme` object that
has tons of properties we can customize to change the palette of all the Blazorise
components
<.> We have to wrap the whole `<Router>` component in order to cascade the color
palette to any Blazorise component.
