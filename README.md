# Personal Asciidoc Notes Repository

Repository for notes taken across different topics, all files are in asciidoc,
so they easily be generated into their own PDFs with tools such as
[asciidoctor-pdf](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/convert-to-pdf/)

## Layout

Folders separate notes taken from distinct topics across ramblings and self-study
done for all sorts of purposes (some problem that had to be solved at work, curiosity,
some problem that had to be figured out for a side project).

## Reasoning

The idea is to make usage of versioning tools and plain text markdown files to make
the notes that are being taken versionable, plus just have them in one place uploaded
for posterity.
