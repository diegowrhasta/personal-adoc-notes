= Introduction

Some notes in regards to various topics around Linux and issues, errors, or things
to know in general.

== Virtualization

If you need to virtualize something, use QEMU/KVM, it's probably the best virtualization
tool. You can install it with a command such as:

- `sudo pacman -S qemu virt-manager virt-viewer dnsmasq vde2 bridge-utils openbsd-netcat`

After that you can open up the `Virtual Machine Manager`. If it says something along
the lines of _Can't connect to the demon_. Then you can start it with `systemctl start libvirtd.service`.

If after that another error around a network pops up: `sudo virsh net-start default`

_Note:_ You can also enable the service to auto-initialize with `systemctl enable libvirtd`.
