= Introduction

Notes taken solely for the purpose of researching Astro's Starlight. How to use
it, pros, cons, things found whilst labbing and prototyping.

== What is Starlight?

A tool made by the Astro team which aims at being high-performant, accessible
and with Great UX. You can generate the content with Markdown, MDX and Markdoc.

- Color themes
- Full internationalization support
- Site search (built-in)
- It has built-in components and also allows for each person to build their own
components (from all different types of frameworks, this is due to the fact that
Starlight is built on top of Astro)
- It even has some "theme-builder" built-in. It's great to randomize or customize
how the site should look

== Setting up

First of all, access its https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/[Docs]

Based on what's there we can start running commands:

````
pnpm create astro --template starlight
cd <PROJECT-NAME>
pnpm dev
````

After this we can access the site on our local machine. (Just look at the localhost
port in the terminal)

The way to start serving content directly is by going to:

----
📁 <project-folder>
	📁 src
		📁 content
			📁 guides
				📝 file.md
----

And if you want to play with the sidebar and the way you organize content there
you can edit the `astro.config.mjs` file.

The main idea is to serve `.md` files that will then get rendered in the page.
(Same principle as Antora). You just write down plain text, and make usage of
syntax to then paint or add color and style to the text that will be rendered
and the whole framework takes care of actually rendering pretty.

It has tons of extra features and inside the `guides` folder you can easily see
how you can format a simple documentation page and on top of that build more complex
stuff if you need to.

Using the docs style generator you can copy css and then following the same guide
the docs has you can then paste that into your local project and apply a new
coat of paint seamlessly.

Search is only availabe in production builds.
